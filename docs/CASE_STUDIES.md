client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=messages
)

# After: SmartLLM Router
from smartllm_router import SmartRouter

router = SmartRouter(
    openai_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_KEY"),
    anthropic_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_KEY"),
    strategy="balanced"
)

response = router.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",  # Router decides
    messages=messages
)
```
